# üìå Executive Summary

Overview

This repository delivers an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Spanish business landscape, based on official data sources. The project includes three key deliverables:

- Original Excel datasets (raw data)
- Python Jupyter Notebook (`EDA companies in Spain.ipynb`)
- Interactive Power BI Dashboard (`EDA Empresas Espa√±a.pbix`)

The goal is to help stakeholders, policymakers, analysts, and business developers gain strategic insights into how companies are distributed geographically and sectorally, and how they are structured by size and legal entity.

## Key Insights

- **Geographic Concentration:** The highest concentration of companies is in Madrid, Catalonia, and Andalusia, confirming their status as economic powerhouses contributing significantly to the national GDP.
- **Sector Breakdown:** The Spanish economy remains strongly service-oriented, with industrial activities maintaining significant weight in certain regions.
- **Company Size:** Micro and small enterprises (up to 49 employees) account for the majority of active companies, highlighting the SME-driven nature of the economy.
- **Legal Structure:** Private limited companies (Sociedades Limitadas) are the most common legal form, followed by self-employed and cooperatives, reflecting a dynamic entrepreneurial culture.
- **Trends Over Time:** Initial comparisons point to steady growth in some sectors and lagging recovery in others, particularly post-pandemic.
